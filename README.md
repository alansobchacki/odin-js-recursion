Project: Recursion
=============

Two basic recursive functions: a Fibonacci sequence calculator, and a merge sort algorithm.

Usually, there's a live demo available. Since it's just three basic functions, there's not much point in building a Github Page for it.

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the sixth project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [6/12].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.
- [x] Using recursion, write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.
- [x] Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

What I Learned
-----

I learned the basics of recursive functions when studying Ruby, so, not much, lol. Still, it was fun writing those functions with Javascript.
